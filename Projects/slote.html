        Slote (Simple Lightweight Openwell Text Editor) is a free and open source terminal-based text editor made in C++. <br>
        Slote is similar to vi, you can press escape to enter command mode, and unlike vim, there isn't a space to press ':' in.<br> 
        You press escape, and then press a key to immediately execute a command.

        <br> <br>
        The commands are a lot like vim. There is 'w' to save, 'q' to quit, 'hjkl' to move the cursor, 'y' to yank, and 'p' to paste. <br>
        You can open a file or make a new file by typing: slote [file-name] <br>
        
        <br>
        Slote is only on linux for now, but it will support Windows in the future.
