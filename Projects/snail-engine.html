        Snail Engine is a free and open source game engine made in C++. <br>
        The engine offers an editor, scripting, animations, physics and much more. <br> <br>
        The engine uses Box2D for its physics engine. The scripting is done in native C++, you can make scripts by deriving off the base script class, and then defining logic for the object you've put the script on in the update and start methods.
        The engine uses an object structure, where you can add objects in the editor and modify their position, rotation, shape, collider, texture and more.
        The engine has saving and loading which it handles with JSON, it has different scenes which are different JSON files.
        <br><br>
        The project uses Visual Studio as its development environment.
